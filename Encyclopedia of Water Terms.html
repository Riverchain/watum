<p>DAYLIGHTING STRATEGIES : These are methods that use natural light to
full advantage to minimize the need for artificial lighting during the
day. For example: a clerestory is a daylighting strategy that allows natural
light into a building interior through a raised section of roof with vertical
glass. Shading of the glass allows light in while minimizing heat gain.
Louvers on the exterior of vertical glass on a house can reflect natural
light into the interior without the excessive heat gain associated with
harsh, direct sunlight. Horizontal light shelves, locataed high on a wall
with glass above (and possibly below) and projecting into the interior
and typically to the exterior as well, are excellent devices for bouncing
daylight deep into a room.</p>

Consumer's Directory of Certified Efficiency Ratings for Residential Heating
and Water Heating EquipmentÓ available at the appliance suppliers'

<p>STREAM: A general term for a body of flowing water. In hydrology the
term is generally applied to the water flowing in a natural channel as
distinct from a canal. More generally, it is applied to the water flowing
in any channel, natural or artificial. Some types of streams: 1. Ephemeral:
A stream which flows only in direct response to precipitation, and whose
channel is at all times above the water table. 2. Intermittent or Seasonal:
A stream which flows only at certain times of the year when it receives
water from springs, rainfall, or from surface sources such as melting snow.
Perennial: A stream which flows continuously.3. Gaining: A stream or reach
of a stream that receives water from the zone of saturation. An effluent
stream. 4. Insulated: A stream or reach of a stream that neither contributes
water to the zone of saturation nor receives water from it. It is separated
from the zones of saturation by an impermeable bed. 5. Losing: A stream
or reach of a stream that contributes water to the zone of saturation.
An influent stream. 6. Perched: A perched stream is either a losing stream
or an insulated stream that is separated from the underlying ground water
by a zone of aeration. 6. SWAMPS: Shallow lakes where a small depth of
water and a slight range of fluctuation permits the growth of aquatic vegetation.</p>

<p> STREAMFLOW DEPLETION: The amount of water that annually flows into
a valley or onto a particular land area minus the amount that flows out
of thevalley or away from the particular land area. It is also the amount
of water taken from a stream.</p>

<p> STREAMFLOW: The discharge that occurs in a natural channel. Although
the term discharge can be applied to the flow of a canal, the word streamflow
uniquely describes the discharge in a surface stream course. The term Ò"streamflow"
is more general than runoff, as stream flow may be applied to discharge
whether or not it is affected by diversion or regulation. </p>

navigable or nonnavigable, and including the beds and banks of all watercourses
and bodies of surface water, that are wholly or partially inside or bordering
the state or subject to the jurisdiction of the state; except that waters
in treatment systems which are authorized by state or federal law, regulation,
or permit, and which are created for the purpose of waste treatment are
not considered to be waters in the state. </p>

cause of acid rain. It is a by-product of coal combustion.</p>

<p>TEXAS CLEAN RIVERS ACT: Senate Bill 818; the legislation requiring the
assessment of water quality on a basin-by-basin basis.</p>

<p> THERMAL POLLUTION: The degradation of water quality by the introduction
of a heated effluent. It is primarily the result of the discharge of cooling
waters from industrial processes, particularly from electrical power generation.
``Waste heat eventually results from virtually every energy conversion.</p>

<p> THERMAL CHIMNEY: A section of a building where solar hear or thermal

a barrier from the elements. A highly insulated thermal envelope allows
maximum control of interior temperatures with minimal outdoor influence.</p>

mass. Such materials react slowly to temperature variations and are important
aspects of any passive heating or cooling system.</p>

<p> TIDAL POWER: A form of power obtained from the filling and emptying
of a bay or an estuary that can be closed by a dam. The enclosed basin
is allowed to fill and empty only during brief periods at high and low

in a concentration which, when applied to, discharged to, or deposited
in the waters in the state, may exert a poisonous effect detrimental to
man or to the propagation, cultivation or conservation of animals, fish,
or other aquatic life. </p>

<p>TOXICITY: The occurrence of lethal or sublethal adverse effects on representative,
sensitive organisms due to exposure to toxic materials. Adverse effects
caused by conditions of temperature, dissolved oxygen, or nontoxic dissolved
substances are excluded from the definition of toxicity. </p>

when the quantity is so small that it cannot be measured in the rain gage.</p>

<p> TRACS : The TWC Regulatory Activities and Compliance System. A relational

plant, principally the leaves, and enters the atmosphere.</p>

<p> TRIBUTARY: A stream or other body of water, surface or underground,
which contributes its water, even though intermittently and in small quantities,
to another and larger stream or body of water.</p>

<p> TROPICAL HARDWOOD: Wood products harvested from tropical rain forests.
Tropical forests are not being harvested in a well-managed manner except
in a few isolated cases. Certification efforts indicating sustainably harvested
woods are just beginning.</p>

<p> TROPOSPHERE: The layer of atmosphere closest to the earth, extending
seven to ten miles above the earth. It usually contains clouds and moisture.</p>

<p> TURBINE: A propeller or wheel device driven by the pressure of liquid
or gas. </p>
