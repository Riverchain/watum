# Welcome to watum

This is the official weblog for WATUM model. This model is officially developed and published by [Mostafa Ramezani](http://mostafaramezani.com), a water science expert and numerical modeling enthusiast. 
This model is based on a Master of Science thesis, supervised by Dr. Rohoollah Noori and Dr. Amin Sarang. In university of Tehran Faculty of Engineering ([Formerly known as Faculty of Environment](http://env.ut.ac.ir/en/home))
This model is open source and you can download, modify and add features to it under MIT license. 

## MATLAB Syntax
Model developed using MATALB syntax. Authors aim for developing a code base available in JAVA and/or python syntax. 

## Easy to use 
This is going to be a plug and play one! Just hit the M file in Matlab and you are good to go.
## Spreadsheet as database and user interface
The interface of the user and code materials is the familiar and friendly Excel environment. You can prepare the **xlsx** file on any spreadsheet editort like MS Excel or other online free tools and save it. Then run it locally in your machine.
